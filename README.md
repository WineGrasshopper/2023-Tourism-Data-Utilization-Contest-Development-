# 2023-Tourism-Data-Utilization-Contest-Development-
Development of new/converged tourism services (web, app, etc.) utilizing public TourAPI (mandatory), Kakao OpenAPI, and various public data APIs.

# Walking Trail Safety Index and Management System
## Overview
This project was developed as part of the 2023 Tourism Data Contest organized by the Korea Tourism Organization. The service aims to enhance safety for walking tourists by creating a "Walking Trail Safety Index" and a management system that helps identify safe walking paths and report dangerous areas.

## Key Features
Safe Path Finder: Provides safety indices for various walking trails, enabling tourists and locals to choose safer routes.
Dangerous Path Reporting: Allows users to report hazardous conditions such as damaged roads, unsafe construction sites, and other environmental risks.
Ecotourism Information: Integrates with the Korea Tourism Organization's TourAPI to offer detailed ecotourism information, catering to the growing preference for ecological tourism.
Data Utilization
The system uses data from the Korea Tourism Organization's TourAPI and Kakao Map API to provide real-time safety information and intuitive map-based markers. Future plans include integrating additional data sources like GoCamping API to expand the service's scope to other walking trails.

## Future Enhancements
The project aims to continuously update and extend the service to more trails and eventually commercialize it as a mobile app. Users who report hazards will be incentivized through rewards and recognition, promoting sustained engagement.
