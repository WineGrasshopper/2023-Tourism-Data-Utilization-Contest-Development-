### Data Utilization
The system leverages data from the Korea Tourism Organization's TourAPI and Kakao Map API to provide real-time safety information and intuitive map-based markers. Future enhancements include integrating additional data sources like the GoCamping API to expand the service's coverage to more walking trails.

### Future Enhancements
The project aims to continuously update and extend the service to additional trails and eventually commercialize it as a mobile app. Users who report hazards will be incentivized through rewards and recognition, fostering sustained engagement.
