## Walking Trail Safety Index and Management System

### Overview
This project was created as part of the 2023 Tourism Data Contest organized by the Korea Tourism Organization. The goal is to enhance the safety of walking tourists by developing a "Walking Trail Safety Index" and a management system that identifies safe paths and reports dangerous areas.

### Key Features
- **Safe Path Finder**  
  Provides safety indices for various walking trails, helping tourists and locals choose safer routes.
  
- **Dangerous Path Reporting**  
  Enables users to report hazardous conditions such as damaged roads, unsafe construction sites, and other environmental risks.
  
- **Ecotourism Information**  
  Integrates with the Korea Tourism Organization's TourAPI to offer detailed ecotourism information, catering to the growing preference for ecological tourism.

### Data Utilization
The system leverages data from the Korea Tourism Organization's TourAPI and Kakao Map API to provide real-time safety information and intuitive map-based markers. Future enhancements include integrating additional data sources like the GoCamping API to expand the service's coverage to more walking trails.

### Future Enhancements
The project aims to continuously update and extend the service to additional trails and eventually commercialize it as a mobile app. Users who report hazards will be incentivized through rewards and recognition, fostering sustained engagement.
